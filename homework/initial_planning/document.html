            <h2>Purpose Statement</h2>
            <p>The purpose of the website is to provide users with quick and accurate weather data so that they can make informed decisions in their daily lives regarding the weather.</p>
            <h2>Audience</h2>
            <p>The audience of the website will be very broad, including people of all ages and from all walks of life, but will be especially relevant to those who make a daily commute to work, school, or other daily activities either by walking or biking.</p>
            <h2>Persona</h2>
            <p>Jeff is a fairly average guy living in Springfield, Illinois, who has an office job only a half-mile away from his apartment. He bikes to work and checks the weather on his smartphone every morning. Occasionally, he will check it again on his work computer during the day to see if it is nice enough outside to go for a walk during his break.</p>
